<h1>Hi there &#x1F44B, My name is Rachel!</h1>
<div class="landing-container">
    <img src="rachel_headshot1.jpg" alt="Rachel Bunsick" class="headshot">
    <p>I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at McGill University. I am passionate about digital logic design, low-level programming,
    robotics, and computer hardware.</p>
</div>
<p>I thrive in hands-on, technical environments where I can combine problem-solving with creativity. As a hard worker, 
    strong communicator, and natural leader, I enjoy collaborating on challenging projects and helping teams succeed.
    Through my academic work, personal projects, and leadership experiences, I've developed a strong foundation in circuit design, 
    C programming, system integration, and project/team management.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore this page to learn more about my work and experiences!</p>
